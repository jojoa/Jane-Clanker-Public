# recruitment/sheets.py

[`features/staff/recruitment/sheets.py`](../../features/staff/recruitment/sheets.py) is the Google Sheets writer for the recruitment roster.

It handles row lookup, point updates, quota status, promotions, section cleanup, formatting, and row sorting for the recruitment spreadsheet.

## Main Entry Points

- `applyApprovedLog(...)`
  Applies one approved recruitment/application-style update for a Roblox username.

- `applyApprovedLogsBatch(...)`
  Aggregates several point/patrol updates by username, then writes them in fewer Sheets calls.

- `syncRecruitmentRolePlacement(...)`
  Moves or updates a row based on ANRORS member/RM+ role state.

- `resetMonthlyPoints()`
  Resets monthly points and recomputes quota state.

- `touchupRecruitmentRows()`
  Housekeeping pass for spacer rows, zero fills, empty rows, sorting, and formatting.

Known callers include:

- `cogs/staff/recruitmentViews.py`
- `features/staff/applications/cogMixins/flowMixin.py`
- `features/staff/orbat/roleSync.py`
- `features/staff/sessions/postActions.py`
- `runtime/maintenance.py`

## Sheet Model

The file uses the ORBAT multi-engine with the sheet key `recruitment`.

Important assumptions:

- spreadsheet ID and tab name come from the ORBAT engine config
- `_loadHeaderMap(...)` combines configured row-model columns with headers found in the first 10 rows
- missing required headers raise `RuntimeError`
- rank labels, quota thresholds, section headers, and promotion thresholds come from `config.py`
- formula-aware reads matter here. The sheet facade must pass options like `valueRenderOption="FORMULA"` through to Google Sheets so Jane can preserve and extend formula-backed all-time cells instead of flattening them.

Required header keys are:

- `robloxUsername`
- `rsRank`
- `monthly`
- `allTime`
- `quota`
- `patrols`
- `status`

## Sections

The sheet is treated as a set of named roster sections.

Common section names are:

- `High Command`
- `Managers`
- `Employees`
- `Members`

The code finds section bounds by scanning the username column for configured section headers. A header-like row or non-member row often acts as a boundary, so be careful when changing `_isRecruitmentMemberLabel(...)`, `_findMembersSectionHeaderRow(...)`, or `_sectionBoundsByHeader(...)`.

## Row Movement

There are two row movement styles:

- rewrite sortable row values in place for normal section organization
- insert/copy/delete a row to preserve formatting when moving one member between sections

The preservation path is `_moveRowPreserveFormatting(...)`, used by `syncRecruitmentRolePlacement(...)`.

## Formatting

Formatting is best-effort and should not block functional data writes.

Main helpers:

- `_applyRecruitmentRowFormatting(...)`
- `_applyRecruitmentBlockFormatting(...)`
- `_applyRecruitmentRowsFormattingForRowSet(...)`

They mostly touch columns `E:I`, unmerge rank spillover around `B:D`, and apply border/alignment/font rules.

## Quota And Promotion Logic

Quota state comes from `_computeQuotaStatus(...)`.

Important behavior:

- `Excused` and `Failed` are preserved
- high command is `Exempt`
- managers use patrol quota
- member ranks use monthly point quota
- promotion checks use all-time points

`applyApprovedLogsBatch(...)` also treats `hostedPatrolDelta` differently for RM+ rows.

The usual approval deltas are:

- recruitment log approval: recruiter gets points only
- solo patrol approval: recruiter gets points, attended patrol +1, and hosted patrol +1
- group patrol approval: attendees get points and attended patrol +1
- group patrol host: gets hosted patrol +1 even if they are not in the attendee list

The sheet writer decides whether attended or hosted patrols count for the visible patrol quota based on the row's current rank. RM+ rows use hosted patrols. Regular recruiter rows use attended patrols.

Patrol duration validation happens before this file, mostly in `cogs/staff/recruitmentCog.py`. The current cap is `config.recruitmentPatrolMaxDurationMinutes`.

## Things To Be Careful About

- This file mutates live Sheets state. Test against a copy or test sheet when changing row movement, deletion, or formatting.
- Header detection is intentionally flexible. Tightening normalization can break existing sheets with slightly different labels.
- Batch updates are optimized around row ranges. Changing sort behavior can increase API writes quickly.
- Recruitment logging channel/server changes usually belong in config/org-profile code or upstream recruitment services, not here, unless the spreadsheet key or sheet shape changed.
