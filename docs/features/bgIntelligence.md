# BG Intelligence

This is Jane's standalone background-check report command.

## Command

- `/bg-intel`
  Runs a one-user Roblox background intelligence report.

  Staff can scan a Discord member, a Discord ID, or a Roblox username.

  If RoVer is missing or stale, staff can provide a manual Roblox username override.

  Staff can optionally attach the full text report with `text_report`. The default is off so routine scans keep the channel message lighter.

  Jane always runs the full scan route. There is no reduced-check command option.

The command is staff-only. Jane allows BG-certified reviewers and server managers/admins to use it.

The public output posts in the channel where the command was used as Jane. Expand controls are locked to the reviewer who ran the scan, and they update the current message to show one public-safe expanded section at a time.

For Discord targets, Jane checks the main server from `config.serverId` first. If the user is present there, Jane uses that guild for the RoVer lookup, then continues the scan in the channel where `/bg-intel` was run.

## What It Checks

Jane currently looks at:

- RoVer link status
- Discord ID lookup status
- Roblox friend, follower, and following counts
- Roblox friend-ID sample for exact known-member friend overlap
- Roblox previous username history
- known-member alt-style username variants, checked only against active ORBAT mirror rows and approved BG queue identities
- local identity graph history, including Discord/Roblox link reuse and stored previous usernames
- staff-confirmed, related, or cleared alt-link registry entries
- manual Roblox username override status
- exact flagged Roblox user IDs
- watchlist / known-banned Roblox user IDs
- Roblox account creation date / age
- configured flagged Roblox groups
- configured group and username keywords
- group quality context like member-count shape, large groups, verified groups, and rank spread
- configured inventory item / creator / item keyword flags
- normalized and fuzzy inventory item-name matching for configured item keywords
- type-compatible thumbnail-hash similarity against flagged inventory item IDs for likely visual copies
- current catalog Robux value for visible non-gamepass inventory assets, excluding assets created by the scanned account
- current Robux value for visible owned gamepasses, excluding gamepasses created by the scanned account
- configured favorite game / favorite game keyword flags
- outfit scan availability and outfit count
- configured badge flags
- full public badge award timeline quality, up to the configured hard page cap
- public badge timeline graph, when awarded dates are available
- optional external safety-source records from TASE and Moco-co
- configured Roblox flagged-group records and optional external safety records
- prior Jane BG queue and BG intelligence records for internal scoring/audit context
- longer-lived minimal Jane BG intelligence index records after the full report expires
- whether inventory is private or hidden

Outfits are shown as context/completeness only. Jane does not score avatar aesthetics, because vibe-based enforcement is not evidence.

## The Score

The score is a review-priority score, not a guilty/not-guilty machine.

Jane starts from a small base score, adds points for configured risk signals, subtracts a little for clean scans, then reports:

- `Low Risk`
- `Mild Review`
- `Manual Review`
- `High Risk`
- `Escalate`

She also shows confidence separately. Low confidence usually means "Jane could not see enough data", not "this user is secretly evil".

Scored reports have a tiny floor, currently `5/100`, so Jane does not imply absolute zero risk just because every visible scan was clean.

Private inventory is treated as incomplete data. Jane gives it only a tiny score bump and lowers confidence, because a private inventory by itself is not proof of anything.

Inventory keyword matching is more forgiving than plain substring search now. Jane scrubs item names into a normalized form, catches simple separator/leetspeak variants, and can use high-threshold fuzzy item-name matching for configured inventory keywords. These are still reviewer aids, not automatic verdicts.

Jane also uses Roblox asset thumbnails for a first-pass visual check. Exact flagged `item` rules double as the reference set: Jane fetches thumbnails for those assets, hashes them locally, and compares them against a capped set of scanned wearable inventory assets. The visual matcher now requires compatible Roblox asset types before comparing hashes, so a shirt reference cannot flag a hat just because the thumbnail hash is close. Close type-compatible thumbnail matches are reported as suspicious visual-family hits, but staff should still verify the actual thumbnail before acting on them.

Known-member alt detection compares the scanned account's current and previous Roblox usernames against Jane's known-member usernames only. It catches simple alternate-character variants, high-confidence normalized fuzzy matches, and names with markers like `alt`, `backup`, or `second`, but it is not a global keyword rule and does not flag a user just because their username contains one of those words.

Jane now also keeps a lightweight local identity graph. It stores scan-time Discord/Roblox observations, current and previous Roblox usernames, and group-membership fingerprints. That lets future scans notice exact Roblox ID reuse, Discord accounts cycling Roblox identities, stored previous-name collisions, lower-noise group overlap, and friend overlap with known members without keeping the full report dump.

Legacy alt-link rows still provide context when present. Confirmed and related links become strong future context. Cleared links suppress the relationship from becoming a name-only suspicion.

Some rules are hard minimums instead of normal math:

- `banned_user` forces at least `95/100`
- `watchlist` forces at least `88/100`
- `roblox_user` forces at least `82/100`
- `username` exact matches also force at least `82/100`

That means Jane will not do silly math like "known banned user, but the account is old, so probably fine." Bonk. Direct hits stay direct hits.

Flag proposals can store an approximate severity from `/bg-flag`: `Light`, `Medium`, `High`, or `SEVERE`. Direct-user rule creation is no longer exposed in the add-flag flow; staff should use the remaining group, keyword, item, creator, badge, favorite-game, and favorite-game-keyword proposal types.

Jane can also return `Not scored` instead of a number:

- `Needs Identity Review` means Jane could not resolve a Roblox account and did not find Discord-side external safety records to score.
- `Insufficient Data` means too many major data sources failed and the result would be fake precision.

If Jane cannot resolve a Roblox account but does find Discord-side external safety records, she still returns a score. That score is based only on those external records and should be treated as an identity-review prompt, not a complete Roblox background result.

The embed also shows `Data Completeness`, which is the quick "what did Jane actually see?" section. This is separate from confidence so reviewers do not have to reverse-engineer missing API calls from the signal list.

External sources are treated as extra evidence, not gospel in a funny hat. TASE checks Discord-side safety records when Jane has a Discord user ID. Moco-co checks Roblox-side safety records when Jane has a Roblox user ID. If either API key is missing, Jane marks that source as skipped and continues the rest of the report.

Jane also does a little bit of "normalcy" scoring now:

- A broad, clean group spread can lower risk a little.
- Mostly base-rank group memberships can lower risk a little.
- Large or Roblox-verified groups can lower risk a little when there are no configured flags.
- Mostly tiny groups on a newer account can raise risk a tiny bit.
- A very thin visible social footprint on an older account can raise risk a tiny bit.
- An established visible social footprint can lower risk a tiny bit.
- A true multi-year awarded badge timeline can lower risk a little.
- A thin or burst-heavy awarded badge timeline can raise risk a little.
- Prior Jane queue approvals can lower risk a little.
- Prior queue rejections or prior high-risk Jane scans can raise risk.

These are intentionally small weights. They are context, not destiny.

Configured evidence also has a soft review floor now. Clean-context deductions can still reduce ordinary risk math, but they should not pull a configured group, inventory, badge, favorite-game, external-record, previous-name, or alt/identity match below the review band that evidence deserves.

## Calibration Notes

The public bot ecosystem does not publish much exact math, because apparently everyone likes keeping the wizard knobs hidden. Jane's numbers are calibrated from the public behavior we can actually see:

- SpiderEye advertises profile data, badges, groups, inventory context, external records, watchlists, and badge analytics.
- RoNexus public examples show a clean older account around `8/100`, and a hard-flagged external-record account around `82/100`.
- Aunto and Double Counter treat detected alt / banned-alt links as enforcement-level signals, not tiny hints.
- Bloxlink-style verification restrictions commonly use account age and group membership gates, so Jane treats truly brand-new Roblox accounts as much more review-worthy than merely young accounts.

Jane's matching behavior:

- Clean, established accounts should usually land in the low single digits or low teens.
- Brand-new accounts under one day old now land around `High Risk` even before other context.
- Accounts under a week old usually land around `Manual Review`.
- Exact flagged accounts start at `82/100`, matching the public "critical hard flag" shape.
- Watchlist and banned-user hits stay above that because those are stronger than fuzzy score math.
- TASE and Moco-co matches can materially raise a scan when the records are severe, but they do not auto-reject anyone by themselves.
- Alt/identity evidence is labeled `weak`, `moderate`, `strong`, `confirmed`, or `cleared`. Weak/moderate signals should prompt comparison, strong signals should usually be reviewed carefully, and confirmed/cleared labels come from staff registry decisions.

The public overview is intentionally thin now: score, confidence, account identity, aggregate scan summaries, TASE-record status, and badge context. Expanded sections stay public-safe and scoped to one section at a time, but they keep the detailed source coverage, direct rule hits, labeled alt/identity evidence, prior Jane context, inventory and gamepass value totals, self-created value exclusions, outfit count, and badge timeline details. Jane can also attach a full text report when staff request it with the command option.

Discord does not allow interactive buttons inside the embed body itself. Jane keeps the message clean with one section picker below the embed instead of a large grid of section buttons.

The action buttons below a completed scan provide quick access to the Roblox profile, a short decision summary, rerun, and a private-inventory DM request when the target has a Discord identity and the inventory scan saw a private/hidden inventory.

Jane caches expensive Roblox reads in memory so repeated scans do not re-walk the same heavy data immediately. Badge award-date lookups are intentionally paced to avoid Roblox 429s, and asset/gamepass value lookups run behind small concurrency caps. When inventory already returns owned gamepass IDs, Jane prices those IDs directly instead of making a separate gamepass inventory listing call.

Visual thumbnail matching only uses validated exact `item` rules. Jane stores a content-focused thumbnail hash and compact color signature for each usable flagged asset and ignores item IDs whose thumbnails do not currently resolve. The hash builder removes the thumbnail background and standard face marks before hashing, and classifies very low-detail neutral clothing separately from detailed/colorful clothing. That means a white tank top can still produce a visual signature, but it should not match camo, orange, black graphic, or other detailed outfits. Jane also looks up the Roblox asset type for the reference and the scanned candidate, then skips hash comparisons when the types do not match. Color is used as a blocker, not as an independent match source: Jane first requires the content hash to be close, then rejects palette/detail mismatches. That keeps the visual matcher tied to real, reviewable Roblox assets instead of arbitrary numbers and avoids cross-type false positives.

Jane also has a separate review channel for BG item disputes and flag proposals. `/bg-flag` posts proposed flag rules into that channel as reviewer votes; Jane creates the rule immediately with the proposer counted as one `Flag` vote, and only removes it if `Not a Flag` votes outnumber `Flag` votes. Proposal votes close after `24` hours; active vote buttons are restored after restart only while that window is still open. The old denied-spreadsheet inventory sweep that posted many candidate items from a user's inventory has been removed.

The pages are:

- overview
- detection summary
- source checks
- profile
- connections
- groups
- inventory
- gamepasses
- favorite games
- outfits
- badges
- safety records
- Jane history

## Inventory Privacy DM

If `/bg-intel` sees a private or hidden inventory, Jane can DM the user and ask them to make it public.

There is no queue state attached to this command, so the rescan path is simple: staff runs `/bg-intel` again after the user fixes privacy.

If staff scanned a Roblox-only target without a Discord member, Jane cannot DM anyone about private inventory.

The older queue-specific inventory retry button may still exist while the old queue exists, but this command does not depend on it.

## Audit Trail

Every successful `/bg-intel` scan writes a full short-lived audit row to `bg_intelligence_reports` and a minimal longer-lived row to `bg_intelligence_report_index`.

The full row stores:

- who ran the scan
- who was scanned
- the routed review bucket
- the Roblox account Jane found
- score, band, confidence, and whether the scan was actually scored
- no-score outcome and hard minimum, when relevant
- signal JSON
- report JSON
- prior report context, when available

The minimal index stores only report identity, target identity, score/band/confidence/outcome, reviewer, channel, route, and timestamp. It does not keep the full source dump.

Neither table stores an approval/rejection. The future Google Sheet queue should own reviewer decisions.

Jane now prunes these audit rows automatically after `24` hours by default. The retention window and prune cadence live in config.

Jane keeps the minimal index longer, `90` days by default, so prior context survives without keeping full background-report evidence forever.

Jane also maintains lightweight identity graph tables for alt detection:

- `bg_identity_history`
- `bg_roblox_username_index`
- `bg_roblox_group_index`
- `bg_alt_links`

The identity graph retention defaults to `365` days. The alt-link registry is reviewer-authored and is not automatically pruned by report retention.

Secrets should stay in `.env`:

- `MOCO_API_KEY`

If those are blank, Jane does not call that service. She will still run the normal Roblox checks.

Flag rules come from the same BG flag manager as the existing scan code:

- `/bg-flag`

The flag manager posts new rules as active votes in the BG item review channel. The `Add Flag` flow uses dropdowns for rule type and approximate severity, then asks for the value and optional note. Vote webhooks persist across restarts until their `24` hour voting window closes; after that Jane leaves the rule active unless `Not a Flag` votes already outnumbered `Flag` votes. The flag manager also has a `Sync Visual Refs` button. Use it after bulk item-rule edits or whenever you want Jane to revalidate the thumbnail-hash reference set.

The BG item review/proposal channel uses these config values:

- `bgItemReviewQueueEnabled`
- `bgItemReviewQueueChannelId`
- `bgItemReviewReviewerRoleId`
- `bgItemReviewWebhookName`
- `bgItemReviewMaxPagesPerType`
- `bgItemReviewCandidateLimit`

Supported add-flow rule types are:

- `group`
- `keyword`
- `item`
- `creator`
- `badge`
- `game`
- `game_keyword`

The severity dropdown is intentionally approximate: `Light`, `Medium`, `High`, or `SEVERE`. Non-direct rules may store severity for future use, but Jane does not currently score group/item/badge rules from that field.

Exact `item` proposals have an extra constraint: Jane expects them to resolve to a valid Roblox thumbnail before she posts the vote. While the proposal remains active, the exact rule drives exact-ID matching, and the validated thumbnail hash feeds visual similarity matching.

Developer maintenance command: `!JaneFlagSync [all|history-limit]` scans the configured BG item review channel for historical Jane flag vote embeds, imports non-rejected rules into `bg_flag_rules`, and forces item visual-reference validation so catalog item rules rebuild their thumbnail hash and color signature rows. The command is intentionally hidden and developer-gated.

## Safe Edit Notes

- Do not make the score auto-reject users. Keep it as triage.
- Do not merge this command into the old queue unless the queue rewrite explicitly wants that.
- Keep the scoring explanations readable. If staff cannot tell why Jane gave a score, the score is not useful.
- Be careful adding new Roblox API calls. This command is interactive, so slow scans feel bad fast.
- Do not score avatar aesthetics. Outfits are useful for availability/context, not suspicion by themselves.
- Treat public badge history as complete only when Roblox stops returning a next-page cursor. Score awarded dates, not badge creation dates, when making timeline claims.
- Keep prior-record scoring gentle. A previous scan can be stale or based on old rules.
