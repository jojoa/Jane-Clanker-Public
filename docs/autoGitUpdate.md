# Auto Git Update

This is the practical map for Jane's Git pull and restart behavior.

The updater exists so the production bot can pull safe code updates without trampling live runtime data. It is conservative by design, because "the bot updated itself into a hole" is not a hobby we need.

## Where It Lives

- `runtime/gitUpdate.py`
- `runtime/configMerge.py`
- `runtime/processControl.py`
- `runtime/pauseState.py`
- `cogs/operations/runtimeControlCog.py`
- `bot.py`

## Main Config

- `JANE_ENABLE_AUTO_GIT_UPDATE`
  Enables scheduled update checks. If this is not set to `1`, the background updater will not run. Manual `/restart` can still check/pull GitHub unless disabled separately.

- `JANE_DISABLE_GIT_PULL_ON_RESTART`
  Disables the manual `/restart` GitHub check/pull. By default, `/restart` checks GitHub and pulls safe code updates before restarting.

- `autoGitUpdateRemote`
  Defaults to `origin`.

- `autoGitUpdateBranch`
  Empty means use the current branch.

- `autoGitUpdateCheckIntervalSec`
  Scheduled check interval.

- `autoGitUpdateInitialDelaySec`
  Startup delay before the updater begins checking.

- `autoGitUpdatePauseDrainSec`
  Pause drain time before pulling.

- `JANE_INSTALL_REQUIREMENTS_ON_UPDATE`
  Defaults to off unless enabled in the environment. When a pulled update changes `requirements.txt`, Jane runs `python -m pip install --disable-pip-version-check --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt` with the same Python executable that is running the bot before she requests the restart.

- `autoGitUpdateDependencyInstallTimeoutSec`
  Dependency install timeout in seconds. Defaults to 600.

- `autoGitUpdateGitCommandTimeoutSec`
  Timeout for each Git command in seconds. Defaults to 120.

- `autoGitUpdatePreservePaths`
  Extra runtime paths to preserve during pull. These extend the built-in defaults.

## Always-Preserved Paths

These are always treated as local runtime state:

- `bot.db`
- `bot.db-shm`
- `bot.db-wal`
- `*.db`
- `*.db-shm`
- `*.db-wal`
- `divisions.json`
- `configData/divisions.json`

The default preserved folders are:

- `backups/serverSnapshots`
- `backups/serverSnapshotsOffsite`
- `runtime/data/copyserver`

Dirty files under preserved paths do not block the update. They are backed up before pull and restored afterward.

## Managed Merge Paths

`config.py` and the focused modules under `settings/` are special.

If local managed settings files differ from `HEAD`, Jane does the careful little dance before pulling:

1. Parse top-level assignments from `HEAD`.
2. Parse top-level assignments from the local file.
3. Record local assignment values that differ from `HEAD`.
4. Pull from Git.
5. Reapply those local values to the new file if the same assignment still exists.

This lets new upstream config fields arrive while keeping local server-specific values.

The merge is syntax-based, not magic. It only understands top-level assignments, so do not ask it to read your soul.

## What Blocks An Update

Jane skips pull if:

- auto-update is disabled
- Jane is already paused
- the local branch has commits ahead of remote
- local code/config files changed outside preserved paths and managed config files
- only preserved runtime paths changed upstream
- the repo cannot fetch, inspect, or pull cleanly
- the server cannot resolve/connect to GitHub

Dirty snapshot or database files should not block the whole pull.

## Scheduled Flow

1. Wait for `autoGitUpdateInitialDelaySec`.
2. Fetch the configured remote and branch.
3. Compare `HEAD` to `remote/branch`.
4. Inspect upstream changed paths and local dirty paths.
5. If safe, pause Jane.
6. Back up preserved paths.
7. Re-check dirty paths, then temporarily stash the whole safe dirty worktree without pathspecs.
8. Pull with `git pull --ff-only`.
9. Reapply managed settings local values when needed.
10. Restore preserved runtime paths.
11. If `requirements.txt` changed, run pip install against the updated requirements file.
12. Drop the temporary stash.
13. Restart Jane if code changed.

## Manual Restart Flow

Manual `/restart` checks GitHub by default. It is treated as a deploy/update command, not a generic reboot button.

If safe code changes are available, Jane pulls them, syncs dependencies if needed, signals the API task to stop, closes Discord, and relaunches.

If `JANE_DISABLE_GIT_PULL_ON_RESTART=1`, Jane cancels the restart instead of rebooting without an update.

If there are no GitHub code changes, local commits, blocking dirty files, network failures, or other unsafe conditions, Jane cancels the restart and stays online.

## Failure Recovery

If the updater fails during apply:

- preserved paths are restored from the temp backup when possible
- merge-managed files are restored when possible
- the temporary stash is dropped only when safe
- Jane unpauses if the updater paused her
- errors are logged and may be written to the audit stream

If a log says a temporary stash was kept, inspect it before doing any destructive Git cleanup. That stash is probably Jane trying to hand you the dropped groceries.

## Troubleshooting

- Jane says local changes block the update.
  Run `git status --short` and look for files outside preserved paths and `config.py`.

- Jane keeps skipping because local commits exist.
  The server branch has commits not on GitHub. Decide whether to push, reset intentionally, or stop auto-pull.

- `config.py` lost a local value.
  Check whether the assignment was renamed or removed upstream. Missing names are logged.

- Pull works manually but not through Jane.
  Check `JANE_DISABLE_GIT_PULL_ON_RESTART`, branch config, Git availability, and whether Jane is paused.

- Jane's terminal shows `gitEnabled no`.
  Scheduled auto-update is off. Set `JANE_ENABLE_AUTO_GIT_UPDATE=1` on the host if you want background pulls.

- Jane's terminal shows `gitResult network-unavailable`.
  The host could not resolve/connect to GitHub. Check DNS/network on the server first; Jane will retry on the next scheduled interval.

- Jane's terminal shows an old `gitCheck` time.
  Either scheduled auto-update is disabled, the updater worker is stopped, or Jane has not reached `autoGitUpdateInitialDelaySec` yet.

- Stash fails because a snapshot path disappeared.
  That should not happen in the rebuilt updater. Jane no longer passes individual snapshot pathspecs to `git stash push`; she re-checks the worktree and stashes safe local changes in one command.

- Update happens but no restart occurs.
  Check whether upstream changed only preserved runtime paths.

## Safe Edit Rules

- Keep `.db` files always preserved.
- Keep snapshot folders preserved.
- Do not broaden auto-merge beyond top-level assignments without tests.
- Do not replace `--ff-only` with a merge pull.
- Treat any kept stash as important local data.
